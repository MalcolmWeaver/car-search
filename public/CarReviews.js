        "Review": "As the gateway car into Honda’s luxury brand, the 2020 Acura ILX has a pretty big mission. It must compete against newer and more sophisticated European luxury cars like the Mercedes-Benz A-Class and Audi A3, but also maintain enough of a price advantage to persuade younger buyers to make the switch.Based on the old Honda Civic platform, the ILX is a surprisingly good luxury vehicle, with a comfortable cabin, numerous luxury and safety features and responsive handling. Its 2.4-liter engine isn’t the most inspiring performer, but it does the job and returns acceptable fuel economy in the process. The ILX also holds its value well and offers one of the lowest ownership costs of any car in the segment."

        "Review": "After skipping the 2019 model year, the 2020 Audi R8 Coupe and Spyder return with updated looks, more power and a reputation as being an easy-to-live-with exotic. While certain high-performance coupes can rattle one’s teeth and deafen the ears even when driving over the most mundane pavement, the R8 feels very much like one of Audi’s performance sedans, and that’s a saying a lot. With all the high-powered straight-line performance expected of a car costing nearly $200,000, the R8 runs comfortably with the Acura NSX and Porsche 911 Turbo, two cars that also share a more comfortable daily driving attitude. \n The R8’s standard all-wheel drive may not appeal to die-hard enthusiasts, nor will its lack of a manual-transmission option, but for just about everyone else, the R8 makes an impressive statement at both the office and the track."

        "Model": "Model S",
        "Review": "The Tesla Model S is an electric 5-passenger sportback that offers up to 373 miles of driving range on a single battery charge. Owners can recharge overnight using a 240-volt home-charging station or take advantage of Tesla’s Supercharger network for rapid charging on the go. At the start of 2020, it’s free with unlimited use to Model S owners. \n Inside, a huge 17-inch screen dominates the minimalist interior and controls virtually all vehicle functions. Speaking of technology, Tesla is a champion of autonomous-driving systems and regularly rolls out new vehicle features via over-the-air software enhancements. \n Meanwhile, a pair of electric motors generates massive torque permitting this sensible but sleek car to outrun most honest-to-goodness supercars while hauling up to 63.3 cubic feet of cargo. Is the Model S the perfect car? No, but it sure is trying to be. If nothing else, it foreshadows our fast and fun automotive future."

        "Review": "By combining manageable dimensions with seven-passenger capacity, a comfortable highway ride with responsive in-town handling and car-like construction with respectable off-pavement capability, the MDX has been one of our favorite SUVs since its introduction for the 2001 model year. In fact, as it trails only the Lexus RX 350 in category sales, the MDX has proven to be a favorite of many. For 2010, Acura has made a number of improvements with new emphases on performance, technology and styling. Fortunately, the characteristics that made the original MDX appealing are still present in the current model."

        "Model": "A3",
        "Review": "The 2010 Audi A3 has succeeded where others before it have failed. Conventional wisdom says Americans don’t purchase small premium-luxury hatchbacks, and the lackluster sales of earlier entrants, such as the BMW 318ti and Mercedes-Benz C230 coupe, seem to lend credence to the theory. Yet, despite all odds, Audi’s A3 has caught on, offering four-door versatility wrapped in a sleek package that forgoes a trunk in favor of a rear hatchback. Of course, it doesn’t hurt that the A3 is priced well below $30,000, offers the choice of gasoline or diesel engines and is fitted with many of Audi’s trademark features, such as quattro all-wheel drive and the revolutionary S tronic direct shift gearbox."

        "Review": 'When BMW introduced its first "crossover" SUV (CUV) in 2000, its marketers called it a "SAV" for "Sports Activity Vehicle." The point was to separate it from other sport utilities of the time and position it as a BMW-appropriate blend of performance and handling with practicality, versatility and all-weather capability. For the most part, it worked, for both the positioning and the vehicle. The original X5 was not the roomiest or most practical of SUVs, but piloting it down a twisty two-lane ribbon of road was a revelation. It drove like a taller version of the 5 Series Sedan, which, in many ways, it was. The 2010 version is all of that, and roomier, as well.'

        "Model": "ILX",
        "Review": "Aside from a new paint color, the only major difference in the 2015 Acura ILX lineup is the absence of the ILX Hybrid. That’s fine, since the ILX got a few much-needed upgrades last year, like the addition of active noise cancellation and an upgraded audio system. \n There’s a new luxury sedan segment that’s opening up, and the 2015 Acura ILX is at the forefront. Priced well below cars like the BMW 3 Series and Audi A4, the ILX is also smaller, but it packs a lot into its compact dimensions. It looks great, and is easily one of the more attractive Acura sedans to come along in recent years. Its 4-cylinder engines come with excellent fuel-economy numbers, and the ILX has enough technology and performance to convince luxury-sedan buyers that they’re being smart, and not cheap. Granted, the Acura nameplate doesn’t have the cachet of the Audi A3 or Lexus CT 200h, but like the similar Buick Verano, the ILX does have one significant advantage: price."

        "Model": "A3",
        "Review": "The Audi A3 and high-performance S3 sedans are all-new for 2015. Joining the lineup are a fuel-efficient diesel engine and a fun-to-drive convertible. \n IMPORTANT NOTE: Please be aware that this vehicle’s diesel engine is involved in a Notice of Violation of the Clean Air Act issued by the EPA to Volkswagen for producing and selling 4-cylinder diesel cars that include a software device that circumvents EPA emissions standards for certain air pollutants. The EPA and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) determined that these diesel cars emit up to 40 times more pollution than emission standards allow. Recalls, investigations and litigation are currently ongoing.\nAudi’s player in the rapidly expanding entry-luxury segment is the sub-$30,000 (destination charges not included) 2015 A3 sedan. Happily that price tag comes attached to a car you’d actually want to drive. Both sporty and welcoming, the all-new A3 and sportier S3 may be small, but they’re a pleasure to live with – a standard panoramic sunroof, bi-xenon headlights and leather seating only sweeten the deal. The new-for-2014 Mercedes-Benz CLA is a prime competitor, as are the cheaper Acura ILX and Buick Verano, but the A3 distinguishes itself as a traditional premium sedan available with a fuel-efficient diesel engine or in a fun convertible version. A hatchback will eventually join the lineup. We like the A3 and we’re guessing luxury buyers looking to downsize will too."

        "Review": "As in the beginning, BMW chooses to market its X5 for 2015 a “sports-activity vehicle” or SAV for short. We’ll just stick with SUV, as the X5 isn’t really any more capable than a comparably equipped Porsche Cayenne or Mercedes-Benz M-Class. However, when it comes to the “sport” part of the equation, the X5 quickly moves to the head of the class. Fresh from a complete overhaul last year, the 2015 BWM X5 SUV delivers an excellent combination of room, performance and economy. And, although it can’t tackle rugged off-road terrain like a Land Rover Range Rover Sport or even the Jeep Grand Cherokee, the X5 leaves no doubt which luxury SUV is the master of the paved road."
